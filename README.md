# MorningsideMacros
Various macros that I use for my evaluations job

##Morningside Macros
I'm preparing this module for use on all Morningside computers at some point. The module consists of
- Gender change and PDF print macros (including the adapation where the PDF doens't have to be saved after printing)
- Replace FNU and replace FirstName
- All macro forms with the macros to open the forms
- A TemplateCheck macro that checks for any templated language or other issues
- A JanitorMacro that cleans up copy and pasted text

##EllenMacros
This module consists of macros that only I use because they're probably too complicated for other people to use effectively.
They may even be too risky for me, but I'm trying them anyway.
- VerbTense 1, 2, 3 to put verbs into the infinitive form
- MegaMacro to make riskier grammar and spelling corrections
- Semicolon macro that converts periods to semi-colons one at a time, making it much quicker to edit a bulleted list of sentences.

##OutlookMacros
These are all macros I use on Outlook.
- All three macro for intaking cases and marking them green
- Case completed macro that loads a form with the case completed email
- Professor Yanofsky that automatically prepares a template with to schedule Yanofsky appointments
